    My work centers on advancing vision-centric perception for driving environments, specifically in the domains of semantic occupancy prediction and test-time adaptation when facing unknown scenes. 
    Looking forward, I plan to integrate these perception frameworks with the growing field of robotics, investigating how to build autonomous agents capable of continual learning and robust operation in complex 3D physical worlds.
