abstract: >-
  A new framework, namely, DeNoising feature pyramid network (FPN) with Trans R-CNN (DNTR), is proposed, to improve the performance of tiny object detection and replaces the obsolete R-CNN detector with a novel Trans R-CNN detector to focus on the representation of tiny objects with self-attention.
